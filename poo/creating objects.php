<!--Creating Objects in PHP
Once you defined your class, then you can create as many objects as you like of 
that class type. Following is an example of how to create object using new 
operator.-->


<?php
$physics = new Books;
$maths = new Books;
$chemistry = new Books;

?>
<!--
Here we have created three objects and these objects are independent of
 each other and they will have their existence separately. 
 Next we will see how to access member function and process member variables.

<!--Inheritance
PHP class definitions can optionally inherit from a parent class definition by
 using the extends clause. The syntax is as follows âˆ’

class Child extends Parent {
   <definition body>
}
The effect of inheritance is that the child class (or subclass or derived class) 
has the following characteristics âˆ’

Automatically has all the member variable declarations of the parent class.

Automatically has all the same member functions as the parent, which (by default) will
 work the same way as those functions do in the parent.

Following example inherit Books class and adds more functionality based on
 the requirement.
-->
class Novel extends Books {
   var $publisher;
   
   function setPublisher($par){
      $this->publisher = $par;
   }
   
   function getPublisher(){
      echo $this->publisher. "<br />";
   }
}

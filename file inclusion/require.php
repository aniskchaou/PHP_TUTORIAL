<!--The require() Function
The require() function takes all the text in a specified file and copies it 
into the file that uses the include function. If there is any problem in 
loading a file then the require() function generates a fatal error and halt
 the execution of the script.

So there is no difference in require() and include() except they handle error 
conditions. It is recommended to use the require() function instead of include(),
 because scripts should not continue executing if files are missing or misnamed.-->

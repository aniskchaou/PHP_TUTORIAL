//Deleting Cookie with PHP
//Officially, to delete a cookie you should call setcookie() with the name 
//argument only but this does not always work well, however, and should not 
//be relied on.

//It is safest to set the cookie with a date that has already expired âˆ’


   setcookie( "name", "", time()- 60, "/","", 0);
   setcookie( "age", "", time()- 60, "/","", 0);

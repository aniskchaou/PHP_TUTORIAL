Associative Arrays
The associative arrays are very similar to numeric arrays in term of functionality
 but they are different in terms of their index. Associative array will have their
  index as string so that you can establish a strong association between key and 
  values.

NOTE − Don't keep associative array inside double quote while printing otherwise
 it would not return any value.

         /* First method to associate create array. */
         $salaries = array("mohammad" => 2000, "qadir" => 1000, "zara" => 500);
         
         echo "Salary of mohammad is ". $salaries['mohammad'] . "<br />";
         echo "Salary of qadir is ".  $salaries['qadir']. "<br />";
         echo "Salary of zara is ".  $salaries['zara']. "<br />";
         
         /* Second method to create array. */
         $salaries['mohammad'] = "high";
         $salaries['qadir'] = "medium";
         $salaries['zara'] = "low";
